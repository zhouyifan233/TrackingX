% SMC_PHDFilterX class
%
% Summary of SMC_PHDFilterX:
% This is a class implementation of a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) Probabilistic
% Hypothesis Density (PHD) Filter.
%
% SMC_PHDFilterX Properties:
%   + NumParticles - The number of particles employed by the PHD Filter
%   + StatePrior - A structure used to store the state prior
%   + StatePrediction - A structure used to store the state prediction
%   + MeasurementPrediction - A structure used to store the measurement prediction
%   + StatePosterior - A structure used to store posterior information  
%   + MeasurementList - A (NumMeasDims x NumMeasurements) matrix used to store
%                       the received measurements
%   + ResamplingScheme - Method used for particle resampling, specified as 
%                        'multinomial', 'systematic'. Default = 'systematic'
%   + ResamplingPolicy - A (1 x 2) cell array, specifying the resampling trigger
%                        conditions. ReamplingPolicy{1} should be a string
%                        which can be either "TimeInterval", in which case 
%                        ReamplingPolicy{2} should specify the number of 
%                        iterations after which resampling should be done,
%                        or "EffectiveRatio", in which case Resampling{2}
%                        should specify the minimum ratio of effective particles
%                        which when reached will trigger the resampling process.
%                        Default ResamplingPolicy = {"TimeInterval",1}, meaning
%                        that resampling is performed on every iteration of
%                        the Particle Filter (upon update).                       
%   + Resampler - An object handle to a ResamplerX subclass. If a 
%                 Resampler is provided, then it will override any choice
%                 specified within the ResamplingScheme. ResamplingPolicy
%                 will not be affected.
%   + BirthScheme - A (1 x 3) cell array, specifying the particle birth
%                   scheme. BirthScheme{1} should be a string which can be
%                   set to either "Mixture", in which case BirthScheme{2}
%                   should specify the probability of birth of new particles,
%                   or "Expansion", in which case BirthScheme{2} should
%                   specify the number of particles to be "birthed" at
%                   each iteration of the filter.
%                   Default BirthScheme = {"Mixture",0.5} meaning that
%                   particles are birthed using the mixture scheme, with
%                   a birth probability of 50%.
%   + BirthIntFcn - A function handle, which when called generates a set 
%                   of initial particles and weights.
%   + ProbOfDeath - The probability that a target may cease to exist
%                   between consecutive iterations of the filter.
%   + DetectionProbability - The probablity that a target will be detected in
%                       a given measurement scan.
%   + NumTargets - The estimated number of targets following an update step.
%   + Model - An object handle to StateSpaceModelX object
%       + Transition (*)  = Object handle to TransitionModelX SubClass      
%       + Measurement (*)  = Object handle to MeasurementModelX SubClass 
%       + Control (*)  = Object handle to ControlModelX SubClass
%       + Clutter
%       + Birth
