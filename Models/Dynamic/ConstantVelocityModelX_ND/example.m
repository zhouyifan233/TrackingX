% Assume a target positioned at x = 1, travelling with speed v = 0.1

% View the transition matrix and process covariance matrices
F = cv.feval();

% Predict the target's position and velocity after the interval has passed
newState  = cv.feval(state);

% Do the same as above, but this time add process noise to the prediction
newState2 = cv.feval(state,true);

% Generate 50 random noise samples from the dynamic model

% Check how likely the predictions we made are
